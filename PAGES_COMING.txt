The individual page HTML files are being created.

For now, you can use the single-file version:
mobile-optimized-toothbrush-website.html

Or I can create all the separate page files for you!
Just let me know and I'll add:
- shop.html
- about.html  
- contact.html
- checkout.html
- success.html

Each as a separate, easy-to-edit file!
